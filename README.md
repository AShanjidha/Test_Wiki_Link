# Test_Wiki_Link

I have written the script using python that will accept a wikiwand link and an integer number

Here scrape function will first validate the link then ->it will extract first 10 links from the given wikiwand link by calling extract_wiki_link function

In the scrape function this process will continue for all the current links, however it will avoid visiting those links been visited before

This process will be continued for 'n' number of times as inputed
